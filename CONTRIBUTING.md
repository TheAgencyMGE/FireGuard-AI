  interface ComponentProps {
    // ...
  }
  
  // Component
  export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ prop }) => {
    // Hooks
    // Event handlers
    // Render
  };
  ```

### File Organization

## üß™ Testing

### Before Submitting
- Test your changes in multiple browsers
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
- Check that data fetching works correctly
- Ensure ML training functionality operates as expected

### Running Tests
